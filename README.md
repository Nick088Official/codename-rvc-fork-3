## A lil bit more the project:

### This fork is pretty much my personal take on Applio. ‚ú®
`Goal of this project is to have a much more flexible base than mainline rvc.`
<br/>
„Ö§
<br/>
**Features that are, at the time of writing, already added in:**
- Configurable learning-rate warmup <br/> ( Provides an ability to give your training a lil warmup, potentially yielding better results. )

- Configurable moving average loss for Generator and Discriminator <br/> ( Helps with better judgement on which epoch to choose. )

- Features a different optimizer: Ranger2020 <br/> ( More advanced than stock AdamW. )
  
- Support for following vocoders: HiFi-gan, MRF-HiFi-gan, Refine-GAN
<br/>``‚ö†Ô∏è 1: HiFi-gan is the stock rvc/applio vocoder, hence it's what you use for og pretrains and customs ( for now ). ``
<br/>``‚ö†Ô∏è 2: Both MRF-HiFi-GAN and Refine-Gan are experimental and shouldn't be used just yet. ``
<br/>``‚ö†Ô∏è 3: MRF-HiFi-GAN and Refine-GAN require new pretrained models. They can't be used with original rvc's G/D pretrains. ``

„Ö§
‚ú® to-do list ‚ú®
> - More / different configurable optimizers.
> - Adjustable hop length for RMVPE.
> - Custom initial learning rate per Generator and Discriminator.
> - Custom gradient norm value  ( from the ui level )
> - Ability to delay / headstart the Generator or Discriminator.
> - Avg for other metrics. ( fm, mel and kl ) 
> - and more...

## Getting Started:

### 1. Installation

Run the installation script based on your operating system:

- **Windows:** Double-click `run-install.bat`.
- **Linux/macOS:** Execute `run-install.sh`.

### 2. Running Applio

Start Applio using:

- **Windows:** Double-click `run-fork.bat`.
- **Linux/macOS:** Run `run-fork.sh`.

This launches the Gradio interface in your default browser.

### 3. Optional: TensorBoard Monitoring

To monitor training or visualize data:

- **Windows:** Run `run-tensorboard.bat`.
- **Linux/macOS:** Run `run-tensorboard.sh`.
