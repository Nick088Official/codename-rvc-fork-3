## A lil bit more the project:

### This fork is pretty much my personal take on Applio. ‚ú®
`Goal of this project is for me to have a much more flexible base than mainline rvc.`
<br/>
„Ö§
<br/>
**Features that are, at the time of writing, already added in:**
- Support for 'Spin' feature extraction. <br/>` Needs proper pretrains. They are in work. `
 
- Features a different default optimizer: Ranger25 ( Ranger21 modified by me. ) <br/> ( Instead of AdamW, uses RAdam as it's core. - Doesn't need warmup. ) <br/> ` Typically better convergence / generalization on average, compared to plain AdamW without a warmup.   `
 
- Allows you to choose Multi-scale mel loss or classic L1. ( from the ui level )<br/> ` ( Optimized. ) `
 
- Support for following vocoders: HiFi-GAN, MRF-HiFi-gan and Refine-GAN. <br/> ` ( And their respective pretrains. ) `
 
- Checkpointing and and various speed / memory optimizations.
 
- New logging mechanism for losses: Average loss per epoch logged as the standard loss, <br/>and rolling average loss over 5 epochs to evaluate general trends and the model's performance over time.
 
- Ability to choose learning rate for Generator And Discriminator ( from the ui level ).
 
- Ability to choose an optimizer used in training ( from the ui level ).
 
- Configurable lr warmup.
 
- Mel spectrogram %-based similarity metric.
 
<br/>``‚ö†Ô∏è 1: HiFi-gan is the stock rvc/applio vocoder, hence it's what you use for og pretrains and hifigan-based customs. ``
<br/>``‚ö†Ô∏è 2: MRF-HiFi-GAN and Refine-GAN require new pretrained models. They can't be used with original rvc's G/D pretrains. ``
 <br/>
 
 
‚ú® to-do list ‚ú®
> - Thinking of more ideas lol

## Getting Started:

### 1. Installation

Run the installation script based on your operating system:

- **Windows:** Double-click `run-install.bat`.
- **Linux/macOS:** Execute `run-install.sh`.

### 2. Running Applio

Start Applio using:

- **Windows:** Double-click `run-fork.bat`.
- **Linux/macOS:** Run `run-fork.sh`.

This launches the Gradio interface in your default browser.

### 3. Optional: TensorBoard Monitoring

To monitor training or visualize data:

- **Windows:** Run `run-tensorboard.bat`.
- **Linux/macOS:** Run `run-tensorboard.sh`.

For more detailed instructions, visit the [documentation](https://docs.applio.org).
